[TOC]


# What

You have a bunch of data, possibly streaming...

```csv
id,first_name,last_name,email,gender,ip_address
1,Rufe,Morstatt,rmorstatt0@newsvine.de,Male,216.70.69.120
2,Kaela,Scott,scott@opera.com,Female,73.248.145.44,2
(...)
```

... and you need to filter. For now lets say we have them already as list of dicts.

You can do it imperatively:

```python
foo_users = [ u for u in users
              if ([u['gender'] == 'Male' or u['last_name'] == 'Scott') and
                  '@' in u['email']) ]
```

or you have this module assemble a condition function from a declaration like:

```python
from pycond import parse_cond
cond = 'email contains .de and gender eq Male or last_name eq Scott'
is_foo = parse_cond(cond)
```

and then apply as often as you need, against varying state / facts / models (...):

```
foo_users = [ u for u in users if is_foo(state=u) ]
```

with roughly the same performance (factor 2-3) than the handcrafted python.

> In real life performance is often **better** then using imperative code, due to
`pycond's` [lazy evaluation](#context-on-demand-and-lazy-evaluation) feature. 

# Why

When the developer can decide upon the filters to apply on data he'll certainly
use Python's excellent expressive possibilities directly, e.g. as shown above
through list comprehensions.   
But what if the filtering conditions are based on decisions outside of the program's
control? I.e. from an end user, hitting the program via the network, in a somehow serialized form, which is rarely directly evaluatable Python.

This is the main use case for this module.  

## Alternatives

But why yet another tool for such a standard job?  

There is a list of great tools and frameworks where condition parsing is a (small) part of them, e.g. [pyke](http://pyke.sourceforge.net/) or [durable](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/durable_rules) and many in the django world or from SQL statement parsers.


`1.` I just needed a very **slim** tool for only the parsing into functions - but this pretty transparent and customizable

pycond allows to customize
- the list of condition operators
- the list of combination operators
- the general behavior of condition operators via global or condition local wrappers
- their names
- the tokenizer
- the value lookup function

and ships as zero dependency single module.

All evaluation is done via [partials](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3252425/4583360) and not lambdas, i.e. operations can be introspected and debugged very simply, through breakpoints or custom logging operator or lookup wrappers.

`2.` Simplicity of the grammar: Easy to type directly, readable by non
programmers but also synthesisable from structured data, e.g. from a web framework.


`3.` Performance: Good enough to have "pyconditions" used within [stream filters](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY).
With the current feature set we are sometimes a factor 2-3 worse but (due to lazy eval) often better,
compared with handcrafted list comprehensions.
